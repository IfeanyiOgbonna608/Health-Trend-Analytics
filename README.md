# Health-Trend-Analytics
Data-driven analysis of health trends for diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer, uncovering demographic patterns, treatment efficacy, and dietary impacts. Features Power BI visualizations and actionable insights for healthcare stakeholders.

Overview

The Health Trend Analysis project is a data-driven initiative that uncovers critical insights into health outcomes across diverse demographics. Using advanced analytical tools (Power BI, SQL, Mockaroo), this project explores diagnostic trends, treatment efficacy, and contributing factors like diet and stress for conditions including Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. The analysis delivers actionable recommendations to inform healthcare strategies, demonstrating expertise in transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights.
This repository contains visualizations and documentation of the analysis, focusing on demographic patterns, treatment outcomes, and temporal trends.

Project Objectives

•	Identify demographic patterns in disease prevalence across ethnic groups.

•	Evaluate treatment efficacy and associated side effects.

•	Analyze leading causes of mortality and their correlation with treatment modalities.

•	Track diagnosis trends over time to uncover temporal patterns.

•	Assess the impact of dietary habits and stress levels on health outcomes.

Key Insights and Recommendations

•	Diagnostic Demographics by Ethnicity

Insight: American Indian/Alaska Native populations showed the highest patient counts for Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, linked to high-sugar diets, elevated stress, and low physical activity via matrix chart analysis. Black/African American populations had the lowest counts across these categories.

Recommendation: Develop targeted interventions focusing on dietary education and stress management for high-risk groups, while studying protective factors in low-incidence populations.

•	Treatment Type Efficacy and Side Effects

Insight: Metformin demonstrated a high success rate for Type 1 diabetes, with headaches and rashes as side effects. Chemotherapy achieved a 100% partial response rate for breast cancer, with sore throat as the primary side effect.

Recommendation: Promote metformin for Type 1 diabetes with side effect management education. Implement supportive care for chemotherapy patients to mitigate sore throat impacts.

•	Major Causes of Death

Insight: Cancer and diabetes were the leading causes of death, strongly correlated with radiation-based treatments.
Recommendation: Optimize radiation protocols using predictive analytics and explore complementary therapies to reduce mortality risks.

•	Diagnosis Trends Over Time

Insight: Asian and American Indian populations showed similar diagnosis increases from 2020 to 2021, potentially due to COVID-19 impacts. Diagnosis peaks occurred in 2008 and 2018 across all ethnicities.

Recommendation: Investigate pandemic-related factors for 2020–2021 spikes using time-series analysis. Conduct retrospective studies for 2008 and 2018 to inform healthcare planning.

•	Dietary and Stress Influences

Insight: High-sugar diets were strongly linked to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, while the Mediterranean diet correlated with the lowest incidence across all conditions. High stress levels contributed minimally to patient counts.

Recommendation: Promote Mediterranean diet adoption through public health campaigns using data visualizations. Investigate potential underreporting of stress impacts and integrate stress screening into diagnostics.

Methodology

•	Data Collection: Aggregated health data on diagnoses, treatments, and demographics.
•	Tools Used: Power BI for visualizations (clustered column charts, matrix charts), SQL for data querying and cleaning, Mockaroo for generating the dataset.
•	Analysis Approach: Applied statistical analysis for correlations and trends, with time-series analysis for temporal patterns and data cross-referencing for accuracy.

•	Deliverables: Interactive dashboards, detailed reports, and actionable recommendations.

Technologies Used

•	Data Analysis: SQL, Power BI
•	Programming: Python (for data preprocessing, if applicable)
•	Visualization: Clustered column charts, matrix charts, time-series plots
•	Documentation: Markdown, MS Word for reports

Future Enhancements

•	Integrate predictive modeling for diagnosis trend forecasting.
•	Expand dataset to include more health conditions and social determinants.
•	Develop a web-based dashboard for real-time stakeholder access.
